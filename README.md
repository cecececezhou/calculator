# calculator

20190506, the first version didn't debuggered.
several errors to be resolved.
I deleted several commands that couldn't be recognized, by doing this 3 errors were left and a few warnings jumped out.  
To be continued tomorrow...

20190603,it finally compiled.
Yet obviously, it can not work as a normal calculator.
And a whole git to learn...
